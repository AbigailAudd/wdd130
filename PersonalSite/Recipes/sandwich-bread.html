        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) warm water (110°F)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60ml) whole milk, warmed to about 110°F </li>
            <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) instant yeast </li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons (1/4 cup; 56g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 and 1/3 cups (about 420–430g) all-purpose flour or bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water, warm milk, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the butter, salt, and 1 cup flour. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, then add another cup of flour. Beat on medium speed until relatively incorporated (there may still be chunks of butter). Add the remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5–8 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5–8 full minutes. If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test”</li>
            <li>1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. </li>
            <li>Shape into a loaf, place in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan, and let rise for another hour.</li>
            <li>Shape the bread: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Lightly flour a work surface, your hands, and a rolling pin. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 8×15 inches. Place into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan</li>
            <li>2nd Rise: Cover shaped loaf with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise until it’s about 1 inch above the top of the loaf pan, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F </li>
            <li>Bake the bread: Bake for 32-36 minutes or until golden brown on top. If you notice the top browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. Dough will be between 195-200°F when done</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for a few minutes in the pan on a cooling rack before removing the bread from the pan and slicing. Let it cool completely before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
