        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a slight overhang on the long sides.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, beat the butter, 1¼ cups granulated sugar, and the brown sugar with a mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs and vanilla, mixing well and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing until just combined after each addition.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and spread into an even layer with a small offset spatula or knife. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining ¼ cup granulated sugar and the cinnamon. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the top of the dough.</li>
            <li>Bake until the edges of the bars are golden and the center is puffed slightly, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan, then remove from the pan using the parchment paper and slice into diamonds or squares.</li>
        </ol>
